This benchmark will test the time needed for three basic ROS tasks and write the output into a csv file

To execute run 

./benchmark.sh 10

from this folder. The only argument is the number of repetitions.
For every repetition a new ROS node is started and the times are recorded in micro seconds for the execution of the following three commands

ros::init(argc, argv, "rosinit_benchmark");

ros::NodeHandle nh

nh.getParam("/rosinit_benchmark/testparam", dump);
